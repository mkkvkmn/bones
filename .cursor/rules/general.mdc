# Cursor Rules for Static Site Generator

## Project Overview

A python static site generator that converts markdown content and templates into static HTML.

`/docs/project_structure.md` - Structure guidance

## Code Style & Quality

- separate concerns
- ignore style related errors e.g. line length
- separate configuration, content and logic
- create minimalistic, efficient and clear code
- provide meaningful errors and logging
- don't ever make any "ensure" or fallbacks - solve the real issue (no workarounds, no special handling)
